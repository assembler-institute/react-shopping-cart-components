# Assembler School: React Shopping Cart Components

In this project you will learn how to create a React.js and how to apply all the
important concepts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### The repository

First, you will need to `clone` or `fork` the repository into your Github
account:

<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg" alt="Fork on GitHub" width='450'>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/react-shopping-cart-components.git
```

## Contents and Branches Naming Strategy

The repository is made up of several branches that include the contents of each
section.

The branches follow a naming strategy like the following:

- `main`: includes the main contents and the instructions
- `assembler-solution`: includes the solution

### Fetching All the Branches

In order to fetch all the remote branches in the repository, you can use the
following command:

```sh
$ git fetch --all
```

### List Both Remote Tracking Branches and Local Branches

```sh
$ git branch --all
```

Then, you can create a local branch based on a remote branch with the following
command:

```sh
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <remote_branch_name>
```

### Installing

First, you will need to install the dependencies with: `npm install`.

Run the following command in your terminal after cloning the main repo:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Running the Tests

The tests that validate your solution can be executed by runing the following
command:

```
$ npm run test
```

### Git `precommit` and `prepush` Hooks

In the `assembler-solution` branch you can see an implementation of these tools
if you'd like to use them.

## Deployment

In this pill we won't deploy the app.

## Technologies used

- `React.js`
- `@testing-library/react`
- `eslint`
- `prettier`
- `lint-staged`
- `husky`

## Project requirements

  that you can all learn together and become better software developers and team
  members
- You must finish all the steps that are marked as `Required`
